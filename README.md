## Project Rationale
Citizens in modern democracies are more likely to select negative news compared to positive news (Soroka, 2014). This negativity bias has important political consequences. Voters have a tendency to give greater weight to negative evaluations over positive ones when forming candidate impressions (Soroka, 2014), and exposure to negatively-charged political discourse decreases people’s sense of political efficacy (Lau et al., 2007) and trust in government and politicians (Mutz & Reeves, 2005). Thus, the negativity bias can inhibit people’s ability and desire to participate in politics. The underlying psychological and neural processes driving the negativity bias are not well understood. We argue that this gap can be addressed by specifying how emotion drives the decision to select negative news. We propose three studies that develop a computational model to examine how emotional cues (particularly negative emotional cues) in news headlines shapes news selection. The first is a behavioral study among an undergraduate student sample. The second will replicate the first study on a nationally representative (in terms of age, gender, and ethnicity) sample of US Adults drawn from Prolific Academic. The third study will replicate the first two in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) context.

Results from these studies are expected to make three important contributions: explicate a new theoretical framework for how emotional cues shape the subjective valuation of news headlines, use a domain-general computational decision making model to specify how the subjective value of emotional cues in news headlines shapes news selection, and clarify the neural processes underlying this decision making. By developing and then applying this model, we can determine both individual and content-based components of news selection in a way that generalizes beyond the specific experimental stimuli tested. In doing so, we gain a better understanding of why people exhibit a negativity bias and insights into practical interventions for overcoming the negativity bias.
